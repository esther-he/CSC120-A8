- Which methods did you decide to `overload`, and why?
I chose to overload the constructor methods because these buildings have many parameters, and sometimes the user might not know the value of every parameter. Having overloaded constructors is helpful so that the code can still be used despite not knowing every parameter.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Understanding overriding vs overloading was a bit confusing at times, but being able to implement it helped me better understand this concept. I realized that the super() functions you could use were based off of what overloaded constructors the Building class had.
